/**
 * ActRelationship is a directed association between a source Act and a target
 * Act. An ActRelationship on the same source Act are called the "outbound" act
 * relationships of that Act. ActRelationships on the same target Act are called
 * the "inbound" relationships of that Act. The meaning and purpose of an
 * ActRelationship is specified in the ActRelationship.typeCode attribute.
 * <p/>
 * Examples: 1) An electrolyte observation panel may have sodium, potassium, pH,
 * and bicarbonate observations as components. The composite electrolyte panel
 * would then have 4 outbound ActRelationships of type "has component".
 * <p/>
 * 2) The electrolyte panel event has been performed in fulfilment of an
 * observation order. The electrolyte panel event has an outbound
 * ActRelationship of type "fulfils" with the order as target.
 * <p/>
 * 3) A Procedure "cholecystectomy" may be performed for the reason of an
 * Observation of "cholelithiasis". The procedure has an outbound
 * ActRelationship of type "has reason" to the cholelithiasis observation.
 * <p/>
 * Discussion: Consider every ActRelationship instance an arrow with a point
 * (headed to the target) and a butt (coming from the source). The functions
 * (sometimes called "roles") that source and target Acts play in that
 * association are defined for each ActRelationship type differently. For
 * instance in a composition relationship, the source is the composite and the
 * target is the component. In a reason-relationship the source is any Act and
 * the target is the reason or indication for the source-Act.
 * <p/>
 * The relationships associated with an Act are considered properties of the
 * source act object. This means that the author of an Act-instance is also
 * considered the author of all of the act relationships that have this Act as
 * their source. There are no exceptions to this rule.
 * <p/>
 * See ActRelationship.typeCode for more overview of the different kinds of
 * ActRelationships.
 * <p/>
 * The ActRelationship class is used to construct action plans and to represent
 * clinical reasoning or judgements about action relationships. Prior actions
 * can be linked as the reasons for more recent actions. Supporting evidence can
 * be linked with current clinical hypotheses. Problem lists and other networks
 * of related judgements about clinical events are represented by the
 * ActRelationship link.
 * <p/>
 * One of the most commonly used ActRelationship types is "has component" to
 * describe the composition and de-composition of Acts. The relationship type
 * allows specifying detail of Acts to varying degrees.
 * <p/>
 * The composition relationship can group actions into "batteries," e.g., LYTES,
 * CHEM12, or CBC, where multiple routine laboratory tests are ordered as a
 * group. Some groupings, such as CHEM12, appear more arbitrary; others, such as
 * blood pressure, seem to naturally consist of systolic and diastolic pressure.
 * <p/>
 * The composition relationships can be arranged in a sequence to form temporal
 * and conditional (non-temporal) action plans (e.g., care plan, critical path,
 * clinical trials protocol, drug treatment protocols). There is a group of
 * attributes in both Act and ActRelationship that we refer to as the "work-flow
 * Control suite of attributes", and which allow the detailed specification of
 * executable action plans. These attributes are:
 * <p/>
 * ActRelationship.sequenceNumber arranges the components of an Act as a
 * sequence or as concurrent collections of components, expressing logical
 * branches as well as parallel tasks (tasks carried out at the same time). The
 * ActRelationship attributes splitCode and joinCode control how branches are
 * selected or executable in parallel.
 * <p/>
 * Act.activityTime and ActRelationship.pauseQty allow one to explicitly time an
 * action plan. Act.repeatNumber allows specifying act to repeat (loop).
 * <p/>
 * The ActRelationship type has-precondition allows plan steps to be conditional
 * on the status or outcome of previous actions. The
 * ActRelationhsip.checkpointCode specifies when pre-conditions of acts are
 * tested during the flow of control.
 * <p/>
 * The composition ActRelationship allows these constructs to be organised in
 * multiple layers of nesting to fully support work-flow management. This
 * nesting and the work-flow control attributes are designed in analogy to a
 * block-structured programming language with support for concurrency (fork,
 * join, interrupts), and without "goto" statements. It is important to note
 * that ALL plans are established through sequencing components (steps) in a
 * composite act (block) as can be depicted in "Nassi-Schneiderman" diagrams
 * (also known as "Chap Charts" or "Structograms"), not by chain-linking acts as
 * in a flowchart diagram.
 * <p/>
 * With the composition relationship, the detail of Acts can be revealed to
 * different levels for different purposes, without the structure of the Act
 * hierarchy needing to be rearranged. This allows supporting multiple
 * viewpoints on the same business processes. For instance, a billing-viewpoint
 * of a laboratory test battery may be as a single billable act. A clinicians
 * view of the same laboratory test battery is as a set of individual
 * observations, where the ordering among the observations is irrelevant. The
 * laboratory's view of this act will be more detailed, including action plan
 * steps that are never reported to the clinician (e.g., centrifugation,
 * decantation, aliquoting, running certain machines etc.). The laboratory's
 * viewpoint warrants a thorough specification of action plans (that can be
 * automated). During this specification, more and more nested sub-activities
 * will be defined. Still the Act is the same, with varying degrees of detail
 * uncovered in the de-composition relationship.
 * <p/>
 * We described the nature of varying detail saying that Acts are "fractal",
 * ever more decomposable, just as the movements of a robotic arm can be
 * decomposed in many fine control steps.

     * A code that specifies how this ActRelationship contributes to the context
     * of the current Act, and whether it may be propagated to descendent Acts
     * whose association allows such propagation (see
     * ActRelationship.contextConductionInd).
     * <p/>
     * Rationale: In the interest of reducing duplication, humans tend to rely
     * on context when interpreting information. For example, when reading a
     * report taken from a folder containing a patient's medical record, the
     * reader will infer that the report deals with the patient, even if there
     * is no direct reference to the patient on the form. However, other pieces
     * of information such as the author of the folder (the hospital that
     * maintains it) may sometimes apply to the contents of the folder (e.g. a
     * report generated by a doctor at the hospital) and other times not (e.g. a
     * copy of a report from another institution). Humans are quite good at
     * making the necessary inferences about what context should be propagated
     * from an item to something within that item. However, incorrect inferences
     * can occur (perhaps the report in the patient's record deals with a
     * relative). Furthermore, computers have substantially more difficulty
     * making such inferences, even though they can be essential for
     * decision-support systems.
     * <p/>
     * Discussion: This attribute allows the clear specification of whether an
     * association adds to the context associated with a particular item (e.g.
     * adding an additional author) or whether it replaces (overrides) part of
     * the context associated with a particular item (e.g. identifying a sole
     * author, independent of the containing item). It also indicates whether
     * the association applies to only this act (non-propagating), or whether it
     * may apply to derived acts as well (propagating).
     * <p/>
     * This attribute is closely linked with
     * ActRelationship.contextConductionInd which determines whether
     * associations that have been marked as propagating will actually be
     * conducted to a child Act. For example, an author participation might be
     * marked as propagating, but still not conducted to a hyperlink to an
     * external document.
     * <p/>
     * If no value or default is specified for this attribute (i.e. it is null),
     * no inference can be made about context. Systems must make their own
     * assumptions on the basis of what data is being represented. (For this
     * reason, HL7 committees are encouraged to specify a default or fixed value
     * for this attribute as part of their designs to ensure consistency of
     * interpretation.)
     * <p/>
     * Examples: An observation event has a patient participation marked
     * "additive, propagating" (AP) and has component observation events linked
     * through act relationships that are marked propagating. This means that
     * the patient participation behaves as a patient participation of those
     * component observation events in addition to the parent observation event.
     * <p/>
     * A composite order is created containing a pharmacy order as well as
     * requests for several lab tests. The composite order has participations
     * for patient and author, and an act relationship to a diagnosis, all
     * marked as "additive, propagating". The "component" association between
     * the composite order and the pharmacy order is marked as conductive
     * (contextConductionInd is TRUE). The pharmacy order has an author
     * participation marked as "additive, non-propagating" (AN), and a reason
     * relationship to a diagnosis, marked as "overriding, propagating" (OP).
     * The order further has a relationship to a dispense event, marked as
     * conductive, and an association to a drug protocol marked as
     * non-conductive (contextConductionInd is FALSE). The meaning would be as
     * follows:
     * <p/>
     * The pharmacy order is interpreted as having the patient from the
     * composite order, and having two authors (the one from the composite
     * order, and the one on the pharmacy order itself). The diagnosis for the
     * pharmacy order would only be the diagnosis specified on the pharmacy
     * order, not the one specified on the composite order. The dispense event
     * would carry the patient from the composite order and the diagnosis from
     * the pharmacy order, but no author. The drug protocol would not be
     * associated with a patient, diagnosis or author.
